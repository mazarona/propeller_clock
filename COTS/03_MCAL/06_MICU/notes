TIMER/COUTNER1
---------------
1) counter register 16 bit
2) output compare register 16 bit (has the value that i compare against)
    -> its devided into two 8bit registers for each channel A,B.
3) input capture register 
3) control register A ( Compare output mode for ch
    a) compare output mode (controls the OC1A OC1B pin output behavior) for channel A and B "I don't really need this in ICU only when i try to outpt PWM"
    b) wave generation mode "TIMER/COUNTER1 operation mode" (also controls how the OC1A OC1B pin output behavior
4) control register B 
    a) input capture noise canceler
    b) input capture edge select ICES
    c) clock source (prescalar)
5) TIMSK
6) TIFR
